# Emotional Design (Don Norman) - Quick Reference

## Core findings

- Emotions are inseparable from how people think, choose, and act; design must account for this.
- Successful design must address three levels: visceral reactions, behavioral use, and reflective meaning.
- Good design is not only usability; it should be affective and help people express identity and social meaning.
- Attractive things work better; aesthetics can improve perceived usability and tolerance for minor issues.
- The three levels are linked and influence each other.

## Level definitions

- Visceral: immediate sensory reaction; concerns appearance and first impression.
- Behavioral: use in the moment; function, usability, performance, feedback, and control.
- Reflective: conscious interpretation; meaning, identity, stories, memory, and culture.

## Level cues

Use these as levers. Avoid overloading any single level.

Visceral

- Form, color, contrast, typography, material, motion, sound, first impression.

Behavioral

- Clear affordances, sensible defaults, fast feedback, error recovery, flow, learnability.

Reflective

- Narrative, symbolism, personalization, craftsmanship, brand voice, social signaling, memories.

## Design checklist

- Visceral: does first impression match desired emotion? Any visual signals of quality or care?
- Behavioral: can users complete key tasks with minimal friction? Are feedback and errors calming?
- Reflective: does the experience support pride, identity, or a story users want to tell?
- Alignment: do the three levels reinforce each other rather than conflict?

## Common pitfalls

- Visceral-only polish that hides poor usability.
- Over-optimization for task speed that strips meaning.
- Reflective messaging that conflicts with actual behavior or quality.

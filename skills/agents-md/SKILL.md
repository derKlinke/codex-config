# Maintaining AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md is the canonical agent-facing documentation. Keep it minimal—agents are capable and don't need hand-holding.

## File Setup

1. Create `AGENTS.md` at project root
2. No symlink required; use `AGENTS.md` directly.

## Before Writing

Discover local skills to reference:

```bash
find .codex/skills -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
ls plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

Read each skill's frontmatter to understand when to reference it.

## Writing Rules

- **Headers + bullets** - No paragraphs
- **Code blocks** - For commands and templates
- **Reference, don't duplicate** - Point to skills: "Use `db-migrate` skill. See `.codex/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`"
- **No filler** - No intros, conclusions, or pleasantries
- **Trust capabilities** - Omit obvious context

## Required Sections

### Package Manager
Which tool and key commands only:
```markdown
## Package Manager
Use **pnpm**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`
```

### Key Conventions
Project-specific patterns agents must follow. Keep brief.

### Local Skills
Reference each discovered skill:
```markdown
## Database
Use `db-migrate` skill for schema changes. See `.codex/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`

## Testing
Use `write-tests` skill. See `.codex/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md`
```

## Optional Sections

Add only if truly needed:
- API route patterns (show template, not explanation)
- CLI commands (table format)
- File naming conventions

## Anti-Patterns

Omit these:
- "Welcome to..." or "This document explains..."
- "You should..." or "Remember to..."
- Content duplicated from skills (reference instead)
- Obvious instructions ("run tests", "write clean code")
- Explanations of why (just say what)
- Long prose paragraphs

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Agent Instructions

## Package Manager
Use **pnpm**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`

## API Routes
[Template code block]

## Database
Use `db-migrate` skill. See `.codex/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`

## Testing
Use `write-tests` skill. See `.codex/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md`

## CLI
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm cli sync` | Sync data |
```

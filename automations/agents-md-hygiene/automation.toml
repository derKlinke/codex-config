prompt = "Scan repository AGENTS.md files and enforce consistency with /Users/fabianklinke/.codex/AGENTS.md. Remove duplicated rules, compress noisy wording, and delete outdated or irrelevant notes. Keep only high-signal, repo-specific constraints that materially affect build, test, review, architecture, or workflow. Never keep rules that contradict global AGENTS.md. Also scan recent commits in each repo for recurring implementation patterns, workflow lessons, and newly repeated constraints; when stable and broadly useful, propose or apply concise AGENTS.md additions. For each modified file, provide a brief change summary and rationale for retained or newly added rules; skip files with no substantive improvements."
